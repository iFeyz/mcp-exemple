# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on initializing and setting up the memory bank for the MCP-Server project. This involves:

1. Understanding the project structure and components
2. Documenting the system architecture and design patterns
3. Capturing technical details and constraints
4. Establishing a baseline for tracking progress

## Recent Changes
- Created core memory bank files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (this file)
  - progress.md (to be created)

## Next Steps
1. Explore the project codebase in more detail:
   - Examine the user entity structure
   - Understand the API controller implementation
   - Review the MCP server integration
2. Test the functionality of both the API and MCP server
3. Consider potential enhancements or improvements to the system
4. Update documentation as new information is discovered

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Project Structure Organization
- Maintaining the separation between the API and MCP components
- Following established patterns for Node.js/Express applications
- Ensuring clean interfaces between system components

### Technical Implementation
- Evaluating the effectiveness of TypeORM for this use case
- Considering the scalability of the current design
- Assessing the completeness of MCP tool implementations

### Development Workflow
- Establishing a consistent approach to testing and verification
- Determining the best practices for deployment
- Planning for potential future enhancements

### Documentation
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage of all system aspects
- Maintaining up-to-date information in the memory bank
- Organizing information in a way that's easy to navigate and understand
