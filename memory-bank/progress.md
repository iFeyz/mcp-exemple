# Progress

## What Works
Based on the initial exploration of the project:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Express API with TypeScript setup
   - MCP Server component
   - TypeORM integration with SQLite

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - User CRUD operations appear to be implemented
   - API routes for managing users

3. **MCP Integration**:
   - MCP server implementation
   - Tool definitions for user operations

## What's Left to Build/Improve

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for API endpoints
   - Integration tests for MCP tools
   - End-to-end testing flow

2. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)
   - Improved code comments
   - Deployment guides

3. **Features**:
   - Additional entity types beyond User
   - More complex relationships
   - Authentication/Authorization
   - Input validation improvements

### Known Limitations
- Basic implementation focused on demonstration
- Limited to user management
- No authentication or security features
- Simple database schema

## Current Status
The project appears to be in a working state with basic functionality implemented. The core components are:

1. **User API**:
   - Express server with TypeScript
   - RESTful endpoints for User CRUD operations
   - SQLite database with TypeORM

2. **MCP Server**:
   - Standalone TypeScript implementation
   - Integration with the User API
   - Tool definitions for AI assistants

## Known Issues
As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, specific issues haven't been identified yet. Future exploration and testing of the codebase will help identify any issues or areas for improvement.

## Next Development Priorities
1. Thoroughly test existing functionality
2. Explore potential improvements to the current implementation
3. Consider adding additional features or entities
4. Enhance documentation and deployment options
