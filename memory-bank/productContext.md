# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The MCP-Server project serves as a demonstration of how to integrate a standard REST API with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with real-world data and perform actions through a structured API, bridging the gap between AI capabilities and practical data operations.

## Problems It Solves
1. **AI-API Integration**: Provides a structured way for AI assistants to interact with backend services
2. **Practical MCP Implementation**: Offers a working example of Model Context Protocol integration
3. **User Data Management**: Demonstrates a simple but functional user management system
4. **Local to Remote Transition**: Shows how to expose a local API to the internet for broader access

## How It Should Work
1. The Express API provides standard REST endpoints for user management
2. The MCP server translates these endpoints into MCP-compatible tools
3. Claude for Desktop or other MCP clients can connect to the MCP server
4. The AI can then perform CRUD operations on user data through natural language requests
5. The system provides feedback to the AI about the success or failure of operations

## User Experience Goals
1. **For Developers**:
   - Simple setup process
   - Clear documentation
   - Easy to extend with additional features
   - Transparent flow between components

2. **For AI Users (e.g., Claude)**:
   - Seamless interaction with user data
   - Natural language access to API functionality
   - Consistent responses with appropriate data
   - Clear error handling and feedback

## Key Workflows
1. **Setup Workflow**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure the API and MCP server
   - Start the services
   - Connect Claude for Desktop to the MCP server

2. **Usage Workflow**:
   - User asks Claude to perform an operation (e.g., "list all users")
   - Claude calls the appropriate MCP tool
   - MCP server translates the request to an API call
   - API performs the operation and returns results
   - Results are formatted and returned to Claude
   - Claude presents the results to the user
